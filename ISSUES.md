READ TO KNOW ERRORS

As of now, we have very few glitches due to:

Code Limitations--
QBasic is a very outdated programming language. It does not submit multi-threading. This restricts
Exitting in-game: Due to this limitation, you cannot leave the game whenever you want. You need to reach certain checkpoints to temporarily possess the ability to save and leave the game.

If you experience a glitch or any issue while running the code, please mail exactly what happened to me @ vishumallela@icloud.com or start an issue in this project's GitHub issues section.
While raising an issue, please mention the following:

1. What exactly happened?
2. What was running in the program while the issue took place.
3. Did the program, QBasic or your computer crash or freeze?
4. Your computer's manufacturer, RAM, VRAM and Sound Card along with the OS you were using.

Fixing this program's glitches/ improving features is one of my biggest concerns. I will try to do my best and fix it ASAP.
