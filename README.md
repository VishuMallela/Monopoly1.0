# Monopoly1.0
A Fully Functional Monopoly game on QBasic for 2 players.

This version of Monopoly1.0.bas has epic features tailored to fit your choices:(y/n choice for each) free parking jackpot , sell back houses/hotels at full price,  un-mortgage interest, unlimited houses/hotels, land on go bonus, and a realistic beep on a bad input.

It also has a larger board, and three new options: trading, quick inventories, and deed viewing.

When you are raising cash, it shows how much you need/have.

Everything happens on the board now.

Sorry: no trading to raise cash, no choosing the spot for an odd building, only one save slot, no comments in code. More features to be added soon!
